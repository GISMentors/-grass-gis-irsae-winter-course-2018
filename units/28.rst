Unit 25 - Classification
========================

.. warning:: Materials under construction!

In GRASS GIS imagery data can be group (e.g. channel-wise) with :grasscmd:`i.group`.
Group and subgroups are used to enable the user to run analyses on any combination of
the raster map layers in a group. Some commands ask the user for the imagery group
and imagery subgroup whose data are to be analyzed.

.. code-block:: bash

   i.group group=L2A_T32VNM_20170523T104031 subgroup=L2A_T32VNM_20170523T104031 input=`g.list rast pattern=L2A_T32VNM_20170523T104031_B* sep=comma`

Segmentation
-------------

GRASS GIS has a command, :grasscmd:`i.segment`, to run the identification of segments
(objects) from imagery data. 

.. code-block:: bash

   i.segment group=L2A_T32VNM_20170523T104031 output=L2A_T32VNM_20170523T104031_seg_04 threshold=0.4 memory=1000
