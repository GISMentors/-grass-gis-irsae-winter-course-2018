Unit 11 - Scripting
===================

Let's start with script created by *Graphical modeler* in :ref:`Unit
10 <modeler-python>` saved into file. Before saving
the script we will remove the lines below to avoid generating GUI
dialogs when launching the script.

.. code-block:: python

   #%module
   #% description: NDVI model version 2
   #%end                

Then we can try to run a script from Layer Manager |grass-script-load|
:sup:`Launch user-defined script` main toolbar.

.. note:: Before starting a script GRASS can ask you to add script
   directory path into GRASS_ADDON_PATH. It can be useful if you will
   run script(s) from this directory more often. Then you don't need
   to define full path to the scripts, its name will be enough.
