Unit 07 - QGIS loves GRASS
==========================

.. warning:: Materials under construction!


Let's step out of the GRASS GIS for a moment. **QGIS** is a very
popular open source GIS package which made a significant progress in
the last years. Nowadays it's used in education, academic environment,
but also in commercial settings. The project started originally more
or less as a multiplatform browser for geospatial data. This is not
true any more, QGIS made important steps for being an analytic
tool. Beside native algoritms QGIS offers also connection to external
software packages like SAGA, Orfeo or GRASS GIS. In other words, you
can run GRASS tools from QGIS without starting GRASS explicitly.

There two options how to access GRASS tools from QGIS environment:

* generic **Processing** plugin
* specialized **GRASS** plugin

Both plugins can be easily activated from :menuselection:`Plugins -->
Manage and Install Plugins`.
