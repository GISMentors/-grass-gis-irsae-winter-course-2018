Unit 02 - First steps

Startup
-------

Starting a GRASS session requires basic knowledge about software
itself. It is an obstacle especially for newcomers. In other words
GRASS forces organizing your data from early beginning.

Before entering GRASS a startup screen appears, the user must define
working project in which GRASS session will operate. Without this step
you cannot enter GRASS. Such approach is not so common. Applications
like Esri ArcGIS or QGIS just starts. The user loads different data
from various data sources in different projections, and starts working
on his/her project. GRASS is different, which makes this software
harder to enter for newcomers. *But don't worry, we will enter our
first GRASS sessions in few steps.*

The GRASS GIS startup screen requires to set up three items:

#. **Database directory.** A directory on local or network disc which
   contains all data accessed by GRASS. It's usually directory called
   :file:`grassdata` located in a user's home directory. *This item is
   set up on Windows automatically, so usually you don't need to
   care about it.*

#. **Location**. Plays a role of "a project". All geodata stored
   within one location must have the same spatial coordinate system
   (GRASS doesn't support on-the-fly projection from several reasons).

#. **Mapset** Contains task-related data within one project. Helps
   organizing data into logical groups or to separate parallel work of
   more users on the same project.

At first define database directory (:fignote:`1.`) if not already set
up. Then a new location ("a project") can be created (:fignote:`2a.`)
or official GRASS sample location(s) downloaded (:fignote:`2b.`). We
will create our own location, a project related to *Oslo region*.
