Unit 02 - First steps
=====================

Startup
-------

Starting a GRASS session requires basic knowledge about software
itself, the users usually do not like it ;-) In other words GRASS
forces organizing your data from early beginning.

Before entering GRASS a startup screen appears, the user must define
working project in which GRASS session will operate. Without this step
you cannot enter GRASS. This approach is not so common. Applications
like Esri ArcGIS or QGIS just starts. The user loads different data
from various data sources in different projections, and starts working
on his/her project. GRASS is different, which makes this software
harder to enter for newcomers. *But don't worry, we will enter GRASS
in few steps.*

The GRASS GIS startup screen requires to set up three items:

#. **Database directory.** A directory on local or network disc which
   contains all data accessed by GRASS. It's usually directory called
   :file:`grassdata` located in user's home directory. *This item is
   set up on Windows automatically, so usually you don't need to
   care.*

#. **Location**. Plays a role of "a project". All geodata stored
   within one location must have the same spatial coordinate system
   (GRASS doesn't support on-the-fly projection).

#. **Mapset** Contains task-related data within one project. Helps
   organizing data into logical groups or to separate parallel work of
   more users on the same project.
