Unit 27 - Regression analysis
=============================

.. warning:: Materials under construction!

GRASS GIS come with different module to do regression analysis. This commands
work with single images or with time series too. Some of the modules are
add-ons, in the core modules f GRASS GIS there are only two: :grasscmd:`r.regression.line`
and :grasscmd:`r.regression.multi`.

:grasscmd:`r.regression.line` calculates a linear regression from two
raster maps, according to the formula `y = a + b*x`; it return some the
regression coefficients: offset/intercept (a) and gain/slope (b), 
correlation coefficient (R), number of elements (N), means (medX, medY),
standard deviations (sdX, sdY), and the F test for testing the significance
of the regression model as a whole (F); this parameters could be saved in
text file too.

.. code-block:: bash

   TODO

:grasscmd:`r.regression.multi` instead calculates a multiple linear regression
from raster maps, according to the formula `Y = b0 + sum(bi*Xi) + E` it return
two maps, one for residuals and one for estimates plus all the regression coefficients

.. code-block:: bash

   TODO

In the GRASS GIS add-ons it is possible to find other modules to run
regression analysis, the two more used, and probably useful, are 
:grasscmdaddons:`r.gwr` and :grasscmdaddons:`r.regression.series`.

:grasscmdaddons:`r.gwr` calculates geographically weighted regression from
raster maps

.. code-block:: bash

   TODO

:grasscmdaddons:`r.regression.series` calculates linear regression parameters
between two time series, the module makes each output cell value a function
of the values assigned to the corresponding cells in the two input raster map series.
Following methods are available:

* offset: Linear regression offset
* slope: Linear regression slope
* corcoef: Correlation Coefficent R
* rsq: Coefficient of determination = R squared
* adjrsq: Adjusted coefficient of determination
* f: F statistic
* t: T statistic
