Unit 10 - Python intro
======================

.. warning:: Materials under construction!


:wikipedia-en:`Python` programming/scripting language is very popular
in the field of GIS and a science in general. Python is also the main
scripting platform for Esri product (see `arcpy
<http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm>`__
package). GRASS is not an exception. In reality, many GRASS modules
are simple Python scripts, eg. :grasscmd:`r.mask` (see *Source Code*
section).

GRASS Python environment includes various libraries, see
:grasscmd2:`GRASS documentation <libpython/index.html>` for
details. We will focus on three main libraries related to this
workshop:

* :grasscmd2:`GRASS Scripting Library <libpython/script_intro.html>`
  as entering node to Python scripting capabilities in GRASS
* object-oriented fancy :grasscmd2:`pyGRASS
  <libpython/pygrass_index.html>`
* space-temporal :grasscmd2:`GRASS GIS Temporal Framework
  <libpython/temporal_framework.html>`

Let's do our first steps from "safe" GRASS GUI environment which we
already know. Switch in Layer Manager to :item:`Python` tab.
