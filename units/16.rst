Unit 16 - Flooding simulation
=============================

Beside DEM (see :doc:`15`) it would be nice to have also river streams
available. We can download this data from OSM database similarly as we
did in :doc:`02` in the case of our study area.

.. note::
   
   .. code-block:: xml
		   
      [bbox:50.85374080,11.50084754,50.98991003,11.67463202];
      (
      way
      ["waterway"="river"];
      way
      ["waterway"="stream"]
      );
      /*added by auto repair*/
      (._;>;);
      /*end of auto repair*/
      out;

   .. code-block:: bash

For simplification you can find this data in sample dataset (`download
