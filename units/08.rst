Unit 08 - Modeler
=================

**Graphic Modeler** allows creating, editing, and managing complex
models in easy-to-use graphical user interface. Using Graphical
Modeler, that chain of processes (ie. GRASS modules) can be wrapped
into one process (model). The model can be executed repeatedly with
slightly different inputs or parameters.

Our first model will be simple as much as possible based on :doc:`05`.
Actually the model will perform two operations:

#. set mask based on vector cloud mask file (:grasscmd:`r.mask`) and
#. compute NDVI (:grasscmd:`i.vi`)

Graphical Modeler can be launched from menu :menuselection:`File -->
Graphical modeler` or by |grass-modeler-main| :sup:`Graphical Modeler`
from main toolbar (or alternatively as :grasscmd:`g.gui.gmodeler`
module from console).
