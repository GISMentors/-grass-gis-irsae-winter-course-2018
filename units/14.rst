Unit 14 - PyGRASS scripting
===========================

.. warning:: Materials under construction!


PyGRASS also allows calling existing GRASS module similarly as GRASS
Scripting Library does (see :doc:`11` and :doc:`12`). The module
caller is represented by :pygrass-modules:`Module` class. In contrast
to GRASS Scripting Library which defines several routines to run
module (:grass-script:`core.run_command`,
:grass-script:`core.read_command`, or
:grass-script:`core.feed_command`) in PyGRASS there is only one caller
technique.
