Unit 14 - PyGRASS Vector Access
===============================

.. warning:: Materials under construction!

PyGRASS allows directly accessing native GRASS raster and vector maps
in the sense of Python objects. This unit shows how to deal with GRASS
vector data by PyGRASS API, see :doc:`13` for raster data.

Vector data
-----------

Vector map can be treated by :pygrass-vector:`Vector` when dealing
with basic vector primitives (points, lines, boundaries, centroids) or
by :pygrass-vector:`VectorTopo` which allows accessing topological
primitives like areas or isles. See :ref:`vector-topo-section` section
for details.

Example below prints nicely format region names and their area size in
hectares.

.. code-block:: python
                
   from grass.pygrass.vector import VectorTopo
   fylke = VectorTopo('Fylke')
   fylke.open('r')
   
   for feat in fylke.viter('areas'):
       print (u'{0}: {1:.1f}ha'.format(feat.attrs['navn'].split(':', 1)[1][:-1], feat.area() / 10e4))
   
   fylke.close()
