Unit 03 - Data Management
=========================

.. warning:: Materials under construction!


Data can be imported simply from toolbar by tools dedicated for
:wikipedia:`raster <GIS_file_formats#Raster>` or :wikipedia:`vector
<GIS_file_formats#Vector>` data formats |grass-layer-import|. Basic
knowledge of commonly used GIS formats is required.

Vector data
-----------

Let's start with data file used for creating our project location in
:doc:`02`. :file:`Basisdata_0000_Norge_25833_Fylker_GML.gml` is a
:wikipedia:`GML` file, which is a commonly used GIS *vector* format.

Import vector data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/import-vector-toolbar.png

   Import vector data from the main toolbar.

.. note:: Dialog for importing vector data is also accessible from
   menu :menuselection:`File --> Import vector data --> Simplified
   vector import with reprojection` or from command line by
   :grasscmd:`v.import` module.

Import dialog allows importing single vector file (:item:`File`) or
multiple files from directory (:item:`Directory`). In our case single
file is planned to be imported, we keep default data source
(:item:`File`).

.. important:: If a spatial reference system (SRS) of vector file differs
   from GRASS location (:item:`Project match`) input vector data are
   automatically reprojected (*please forget about on-the-fly
   reprojection*, GRASS simply does not support such dangerous
   feature) into location projection.

.. figure:: ../images/units/03/import-vector-dialog.png

   Dialog for importing vector file(s). Input file
   :file:`Basisdata_0000_Norge_25833_Fylker_GML.gml` contains several
   layers, we choose "Filke" (administrative regions) to import.

.. note:: In some cases SRS of imported file can be missing or
          invalid. GRASS reports this issue as *In case of no
          significant differences in the projection definitions, use
          the -o flag to ignore them and use current location
          definition.  Consider generating a new location from the
          input dataset using the 'location' parameter.*

          GRASS allows importing such file by overriding project check
          (if you are really sure that SRS of input file is the same
          as GRASS location).

          .. figure:: ../images/units/03/override-projection-check.svg

             Override projection check to force import.
