Unit 15 - Reprojection
======================

.. warning:: Materials under construction!


In order to perform simple flooding simulation we need
digital elevation model (DEM) for our area of interest (AOI).
There are several options like global DEM datasets (SRTM,
EU-DEM, ...), local DEMs created as a product of laser scanning
techniques.

In our example we will use EU-DEM global dataset provided by
`Copernicus programme
<https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/copernicus-land-monitoring-service-eu-dem#tab-gis-data>`__. Let's
download tile covering our region, be aware data are quite
big (4GB), see note below. There is no need to import into GRASS the
whole big DEM tile. By using ``-r`` flag of :grasscmd:`r.in.gdal` we
can import just a subregion covering our AOI.
